# JavaScript Book Club

## Description

In this project, I've create a list for a book club with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). While the site is simple, the value in this site is using a json file for the book list and then using React to map through the data to display on the site for the user. Bootstrap was used for styling with minimal modifications for a newer color scheme.

The starter code was provided by MIT xPro.

## How to Run

To run this program, simply open the index.html file in your browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

Future improvements will include adding a Nav Bar and Footer for additional JavaScript resources.
